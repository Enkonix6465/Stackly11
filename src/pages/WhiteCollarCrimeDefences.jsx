              White-collar crime charges are complex and require expert legal defense strategies. Understanding common defenses can help protect your rights and freedom.
            </p>
            <h2>Understanding White-Collar Crimes</h2>
            <p>
              These offenses typically involve non-violent financial crimes such as fraud, embezzlement, money laundering, or regulatory violations. The stakes are often high, with significant penalties.
            </p>
            <h2>Common Defenses</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
              <li><strong>Lack of Intent:</strong> Proving the accused did not knowingly or deliberately commit the offense.</li>
              <li><strong>Insufficient Evidence:</strong> Challenging the prosecution's proof and highlighting reasonable doubt.</li>
              <li><strong>Procedural Errors:</strong> Identifying violations in investigation or arrest that may invalidate evidence.</li>
              <li><strong>Reliance on Expert Advice:</strong> Demonstrating compliance based on advice from legal or financial experts.</li>
              <li><strong>Statute of Limitations:</strong> Arguing the case was filed after the legally allowed time frame.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Importance of Skilled Legal Representation</h2>
            <p>
              White-collar crime cases are often technically and legally nuanced. An experienced attorney will conduct a thorough investigation, identify weaknesses in the prosecutionâ€™s case, and craft a strategic defense tailored to your situation.
